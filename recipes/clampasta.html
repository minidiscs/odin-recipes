            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Spaghetti with Clams is a absolute classic that can come together quickly. I always find this dish deeply satisfying. Rich toothsome noodles coated in a silky umami sauce with chunks of clams. If you don't have fresh clams, use canned. If you want to mix it up a bit, toss in a small can of tomatoes. Add spinach to make it "healthy". You cannot go wrong with this dish... Unless, of course, you over cook the pasta. Al dente is the way forward. Enjoy!</p>

                <li>12 - 16 littleneck clams</li>
                <li>3 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
                <li>3 cloves chopped Garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon Crushed Red Pepper</li>
                <li>1 handful of chopped parsely</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of sake or vermouth</li>
                <li>1 fresh lemon</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of appropriately salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, soak clams in cold water.</li>
                <li>Add spaghetti to boiling water, and cook until slightly underdone; pasta will finish cooking in sauce. Meanwhile, place a large saucepan over medium-low heat, and add olive oil, garlic and chili pepper. Saut√© gently, reducing heat if necessary so garlic does not brown.</li>
                <li>Add vermouth and clams, and cover. Clams should open in about 2 minutes. (If pasta is ready first, drain it and toss with a small amount of olive oil.) Add hot drained pasta, cover, and shake pot gently. Allow to simmer for another 1 or 2 minutes until it is done to taste.</li>
                <li>Discard any clams that have not opened. Add half the parsley, and shake pan to distribute evenly. Transfer to a plate or bowl, and sprinkle with remaining parsley.</li>
