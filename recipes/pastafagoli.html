        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta fagoli can really be anything that encompasses pasta and beans put together and served. Tomato is the most frequent addition. Combine this with onion, celery, fennel and carrot we have a hearty soup that can satisfy all types of cravings. A copious addition of fresh torn kale adds harmonous color and delicate balance. Always served topped with a large amount of extra virgin olive oil, freshly grated parm, and freshly cracked pepper.</p>
