            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>You'll know there's only 2 primary ingredients to this soup, but you'll be forgetting that as soon as you sit down at the table for a bowl. You'll have guests think you're lying about it and vegans convinced you're poisoning them with a rich meat based stock, but yes, there's only two ingredients. There's much more flavor going on that you'll be pinching yourself in disbelief. Enjoy!</p>
