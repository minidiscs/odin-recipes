            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Bright, vibrant and refreshing. This salad is known as Salad-e Shirazi in Iran and is a common pairing to many Iranian meals. It's made with simple and fresh ingredients and requires little prep. It's very important to get good quality English or Persian cucumbers, fresh crisp tomatoes, and onion. Be sure to chop all the vegetables into cubes roughly the same size.</p>
