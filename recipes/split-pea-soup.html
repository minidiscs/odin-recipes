            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A foggy day classic. You don't need to add a ham hock, but it's better with it. Be careful with your salt if your using the hock, as quite a bit salt comes out of the meat. Don't be afraid to do most of your salting near the end of the cook time. Serve with saltine crackers and plenty of freshly cracked pepper.</p>
